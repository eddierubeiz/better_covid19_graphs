        <h1>The US COVID-19 epidemic by location</h1>
        <p>
            About a week ago, I watched <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc">Henry Reich's critique</a> of the COVID-19 graphs we tend to see in the media, all of which look to me like a bunch of backwards capital <em>&#8515;</em> 's. Examining <a href ="https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/">work</a> by <a href="https://aatishb.com/about/">Aatish Bhatia</a>, Reich notes that plotting time series for exponential phenomena is a waste of time because:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0">The spread of the disease doesn't care if it's March or April.  It only cares about two things: how many cases there <em>ARE</em> today, and how many new cases there <em>WILL BE</em> today.</p>
          <footer class="blockquote-footer"<cite title="Source Title">Henry Reich</cite></footer>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Now that many counties in the United States have cases numbering in the thousands, I'm using Bhatia's approach for a county-by-county analysis of the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series">COVID-19</a> statistics provided by the <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)</a> using <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>. The result is below:<p>

        <h2>How to read the chart:</h2>
        <p> Each line plots the progress of the epidemic in a particular place; most places are counties. Places with fewer than two thousand cases as of today are not represented.</p>
        <p>
            Both axes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale">logarithmic</a>, so the numbers 10 and 100, and 100 and 1000 are equally spaced. (The X axis does <em>not</em> represent time, but the <em>number of cases</em>. The X axis does <em>not</em> represent the number of cases, but the <em>number of new cases on a particular day</em>. To see which day, just hover your mouse over the chart.
